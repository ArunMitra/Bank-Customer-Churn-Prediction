## Prediciting Customer Churn for a European Retail Bank


From established enterprises to start-ups, good models for customer churn prediction are a vital necessity to:

- Better understand future revenue
- Understand areas where customer service needs improvement
- Target customer retention efforts and costs more effectively
- Find customers for whom existing marketing efforts have become ineffective

Data is from an anonymized global bank with ~10,000 labelled data points with 12 features.

- customer_id
- credit_score
- country
- gender
- age
- tenure
- balance
- products_number
- credit_card
- active_member
- estimated_salary
- churn, used as the target.

Several different churn prediction models are examined, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosted Classifier

## The problem

- For all B2C businesses, including retail banks
  Customer lifetime value is key
  Loyalty is everything!

- Average churn for retail banks is 20% to 25% (Source:https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/customer-churn-banking/)
 
- Lost revenue from churned ex-customers is very hard to replace

## What can be done?

- Identify likely churners
- Launch targeted retention campaigns
  -- Get frequent feedback
  -- Improve customer service
  -- Improve digital self-service 
  -- Reduce fees & rates
  -- Increase savings interest rates
  -- Offer a wider variety of financial products

All of the above cost a varying amount of $$$$. How much should we spend?
